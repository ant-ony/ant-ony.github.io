                        <strong>Antony Manokhin</strong> is currently a third year student
                        at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY.  He was born in Bronxville, NY,
                        and grew up in Connecticut.  At Vassar, Antony studies computer science
                        and economics.  In those fields, he is passionate about artificial intelligence 
                        and temporal networks, modeling and simulation, and software development. 

                        Outside of the classroom, Antony is an advocate for the free exchange of ideas;
                        currently, he is the co-president of the Vassar Debate Society and co-hosts his own college-dorm podcast.   He has grown up speaking English, Spanish, and Russian; he prides himself on communicating across language barriers.  Additionally, Antony is an avid runner - on hiking trails, sleepy roads, and for the Vassar Track and Field team.
