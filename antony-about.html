                        <strong>Antony Manokhin</strong> is currently a fourth year student
                        at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY.  He was born in Bronxville, NY,
                        and grew up in Connecticut.  At Vassar, Antony studies computer science
                        and economics.  In those fields, he is passionate about artificial intelligence 
                        and neural networks, modeling and simulation, and software development. 

                        Outside of the classroom, Antony is a leader and self-starter;
                        currently, he is Vassar's 2018 Senior Class President and always has a personal project on his mind.  He has grown up speaking English, Russian, and Spanish, and prides himself on communicating across language barriers.  Additionally, Antony is an avid runner - on hiking trails, sleepy roads, and in community races.
